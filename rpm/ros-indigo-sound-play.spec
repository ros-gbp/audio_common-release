%description
sound_play provides a ROS node that translates commands on a ROS topic
(robotsound) into sounds. The node supports built-in sounds, playing OGG/WAV
files, and doing speech synthesis via festival. C++ and Python bindings allow
this node to be used without understanding the details of the message format,
allowing faster development and resilience to message format changes.
